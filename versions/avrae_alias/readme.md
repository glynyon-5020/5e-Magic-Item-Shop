# Populate Shop Alias

This alias was crafted for the Avrae bot on discord. All you need do is run the [alias](https://github.com/glynyon-5020/5e-Magic-Item-Shop/blob/main/versions/avrae_alias/populate_shop.alias) command (copied and pasted) into discord within a channel that Avrae is also present. 

If you want the alias to be accessible by the entire server you're on, and you have the correct permissions, just change the prefix `!alias` to `!servalias`.

Once the alias is live for you or your sever, you can magically generate a list of items when you run this command. It's as simple as typing `!populate_shop 5`.
- `5` is a number that you can change to any number you wantâ€”so long as it's a number! If you don't type a number, it'll generate a single item.
- So `5` would generate 5 items; 17 would generate `17` and so on

These items include all official content.
